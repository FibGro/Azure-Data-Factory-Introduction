## General Information
This is part of learning process to get better understanding of using Azure Data Factory. The process is followed the Udemy course. 
We will learn how to build a real world project using Azure Data Factory. This course has been taught using real world data from COVID Cases. 
Detail learning process: 
- Ingest data from sources such as HTTP and Azure Blob Storage into Azure Data Lake Gen2 using Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Transform data using Data Flows in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and load into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Transform data using Databricks Notebook Activity in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and load into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Transform data using Azure HDInsight Activity in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and load into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Load transformed data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to Azure SQL Database using Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Use Triggers in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and how to use them to schedule the data pipelines.
- Monitor pipelines using Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Monitor and Log Analytics with a real-world project.
- Build production ready pipelines and good practices and naming standards
- Create CI/CD pipelines in Azure Devops to release ADF pipelines to higher environments (Testing/ Production)

## Technologies Used
